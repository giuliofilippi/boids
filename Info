The goal of this python code is to explore how a group of boids following simple rules can
show fairly complex group behaviour


the idea is to create a boid class that generates an object with coordinates and simple rules
to get the coordinates at the next time step based on it's neighbourhood


each boid has a field of vision and it's position vector will be determined by it's position, velocity and
it's neighbourhood's velocities.

The boids must also have a rule to help them avoid obstacles including potentially other boids

To do so I think I need to create a void class, generating about 100 bodies in a 800*800
Screen. 


Boids are little non equilateral triangles with a sense of direction.


I need to figure out what their constant speed should be.


I need to figure out how to make them avoid objects and other boids.





The rules for generating next positions and velocities for all boids are rather simple,
Can look up some references online.
